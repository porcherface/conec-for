# CONEC FOR

connect4 blockchain implementation. bet ether against other opponents!

# temporary:

this contract is not yet deployed and is under development. interfaces have been distributed in the contract folder.
you can use these interfaces to create a gaming gui for yourself, or use my python script to have an ugly but working gaming client.

# take a look at my other solidity projects:

 - attr-act, an NFT factory (Deployed on ROPSTEN network already!), currently in version 0.0.1
